| Divisibility by 3 failed, Divisibility by 3 passed|370a69d7dc5cbec80693d14856550b0b900c385d, eedeccaddbcb35f9b4408b4c379d78f4bf1cfdb6  | Here we want to test if when the number is divisible by 3 returns "Fizz". The test initially failed and the code was refactored for the test group to pass.                    Test passed: <img src="images/test 1 fail.png"> test succeed: <img src="image/test 1 reussi.png">

| Divisibility by 3 and 5 failed, Divisibility by 3 and 5 passed | | Here we want to test if when the number is divisible by 3 and 5 returns "FizzBuzz". The test initially failed and the code was refactored for the test group to pass.    Test failed: <img src="images/test 3 fail.png"> Test succeed: <img src="images/test 3 reussi.png">
| Negative number, Negative number passed end fail | | Here we want to test if a negative number can be "Fizz" or "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz". The test initially failed and the code was refactored for the test group to pass.    Test failed: <img src="images/test 4 fail.png"> test succeed: <img src="images/test 4 reussi.png">
| Check if 0 is divisible by 3 or 5 | | Here we want to test if 0 is  "Fizz" or "Buzz" so we expect true. The test initially failed and the code was refactored for the test group to pass.
